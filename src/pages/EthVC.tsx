                We aim to bridge the gap between VCs wishing to better

                with little VC network and access. The “EthVC Track” is a unique

                On the 1st Day of the conference (July 20th), investors will
                have access to the numerous conferences, including workshops
                addressed to the neophytes wishing to learn fast about
                blockchain and Ethereum, as well as talks led by the start-ups
                that will be pitching on the VC stage. On Days 2 and 3 (July
                21st & 22nd): VCs have access to a dedicated Pitch Room where
                selected startups will pitch their project to our community of
                investors- for the sake of efficiency and confidentiality, the
                Pitch Room will only be available to registered members with a
                VC Track Pass. The Pitch Room schedule will be shared ahead of
                the event, along with company details, short abstract, CEO
                profile, and fundraising asks. There will be both equity based
                and token based projects
